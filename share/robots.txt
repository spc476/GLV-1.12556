# Control what autonomous agents (bots) should not crawl in your site.  
# See http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html for more information about the
# actual robots.txt format.
#
# Since Gemini makes it impossible for user-agents to identify themselves,
# Gemini itself defines the concept of "virtual user agent".  Currently,
# the following user-agents are defined:
#
#	archiver
#	indexer
#	researcher
#	webproxy
#
# An autonomous agent crawling Gemini should look for one of those terms
# and follow the rules.  For more information about this, see
# gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/companion/robots.gmi
#
# The following will block all autonomous agents from crawling your site.

User-agent: *
Disallow: /
